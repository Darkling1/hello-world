Coding is something utterly beautiful
In my point of view, coding can be very difficult in some cases, but also very reliefing and fullfilling, whenever you find the mistake you made, or write a code which leads to a bigger picture. 
I really hope to find myself in GitHub more often and connect with people here, who share the same interst.
